# Direct-Connext
This is an application similar to DC++ (A file sharing aid over intranet).


The whole of source code is written purely in JAVA.


# Procedure
1) Copy Serverfiles on a computer and Clientfiles onto another. 


2) In Client.java, change the IP from "localhost" to the ip address of the server computer. The server ip is displayed on the Server terminal.


3) Compile the given source codes using the command javac *.java on both the computers.


4) Ignore -Xlint request while compiling.


5) Run the ServerGUI on the serverside, and ClientGUI on the client side.


6) The remaining steps are self-explanatory.


# Purpose


1) I-ON connects every hostel block in MUJ, this provides an efficient yet easy way to share files over the internet.


2) Faster Downloads of speeds upto 50+Mbps, i.e. actual download speed may vary, but averages around 20Mbps.


3) It is not necessary to be *logged-in* on I-ON !!! This means, you can send and recieve files without consuming your I-ON data.
